He is the founder of Apple Incorporated, a corporate giant and one of the most prominent companies in the world. He has changed the world forever with his groundbreaking technologies. His brilliance has had cultural impacts and changed modern day lifestyle.</p>

    <p class="smol">Jobs had a lot of up and downs in his life and career. He was born in San Fransisco, before being put up for adoption. He had dropped out of college in the first year and travelled to India, to recieve spiritual enlightenment. He co-founded Apple with Steve Wozniak in 1976. The company started off strong with the Apple 2, but the following Apple Lisa struggled to gain traction. However, redemption came in the form of the Macintosh.This was the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. However, due to power conflicts within the company, Jobs was forced out of Apple. In response, he and a few Apple employees founded NeXT,a computer platform development company. He also worked with George Lucas on star wars films, being in charge of the graphics division, which would go on to become Pixar. While all this was happening, Apple was struggling and aqquired NeXT as a last ditch attempt. Jobs had regained his position as CEO and played a vital part in saving the company and turning it into the dynasty it is today. 
    <br>
    <p class="red"> All in all, Steve Jobs is one of the most influencial figures in computer science of all time, and has paved a path for millions of young computer scientists to follow their aspirations. </p>
